From the Getting Started guide (good context):
Processes and links play an important role when building fault-tolerant
systems. Elixir processes are isolated and donâ€™t share anything by default.
Therefore, a failure in a process will never crash or corrupt the state of
another process. Links, however, allow processes to establish a relationship
in case of failure. We often link our processes to supervisors which will
detect when a process dies and start a new process in its place.
"""

# spawn/1 and spawn_link/1 are basic primitives for creating processes, but
# most of the time we'll use abstractions built on top of them to do more.
# Task.start/1 and Task.start_link/1 return {:ok, pid} rather than just pid
# also it provides better error reports.
# Task module also has Task.async/1 and Task.await/1 which I'll want to learn.
Task.start fn -> raise "oops" end
